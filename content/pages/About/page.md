Upstairs is Boiling creates music grounded in improvisation and live composition. The collective draws from a repertoire of past compositions and poems while also embracing the spontaneous creation of new musical expressions. Each member is a multi-instrumentalist, allowing the group to craft a fluid, formless sound that shifts and evolves, engaging the audience in playful and unpredictable rituals. The stage welcomes everything willing to explore music in the same spirit.
