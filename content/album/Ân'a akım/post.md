This album, Ân'a Akım, was recorded and shared with the world in 2024 by a group of people who enjoy making music together in a studio in Kadıköy. The world taught them everything they know, and they, in turn, have shared some of what they learned with the world.

Their time spent together, without conflict or competition, revealed a sense of ease within them. Moving away from general ideas and definitions, they began to produce sounds they themselves would enjoy listening to. They created musical spaces for each other. Their music is carefree and spontaneous.

For this reason, it is bold, with art as its sole intention.
Can music be recorded? It is unclear, but some moments can turn into music and be captured.

The entire album was played, composed, and sung at the same time. This is the reason behind its existence.

Ân'a Akım is like breaking away from the highways and plunging into the forest, setting up camp somewhere close to the city, not too far in. It is a gentle attempt.
