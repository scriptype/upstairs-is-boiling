Is it possible to create a musical conversation in that moment, right then and there, that both the performers and the listeners can genuinely enjoy? The answer is: sometimes. Sometimes music seems to happen by accident. And in those "sometimes," it is possible to hear something truly delicate and graceful. Upstairs is Boiling tries to find that resonance within and beyond. This time the great performer Melisa Diktaş dances with the crew at a beautiful rooftop, Jazz Pod at Taksim, Istanbul.
